# javascript-music-events
This is a javascript app I built for Wes Bos' 30 days of code challenge.
It plays drum sounds and does a little animation depending on the pressed key.
It works by listening for a keydown event on the window object, then calling a function which runs a test to see if the pressed key has a drum sound, if it does, it creates a new audio object and inserts a value corresponding to the pressed key into the url.
